abstract = {Presently, computational intelligence plays a major role in the areas of artificial intelligence–based neural network, fuzzy network and natural language processing, diligence-based games cognitive developmental computing, genetic algorithm, deep and machine learning, evolutionary computing under sustainable computing, and optimization methods. Several uncertainties raised in multivariant complexity for mathematical-based computational reasoning cannot be converted in machine language, which can be understood by computer. But the computational intelligence gives various solutions for many issues in real-world problems. The uncertainty fuzziness issues could be solved through computational artificial intelligence–based neural networks, which understand the real world as well as experimental facts through biological and evolutionary computing and machine learning with probabilistic methods. Swarm-based artificial intelligence and intelligent robotic immune systems is also an integral part of computational intelligence in sustainable computing. Presently, computational-based intelligence-based various fuzzy logic concepts has been enforced through fuzzifier and de-fuzzifier with assistance of crisp sets in automated control-based aerospace engineering, cooperative business with suitable logical decision-making, highly productive-based industrial engineering process, efficient automotive traffic control, and other real-time environment. Computational intelligence enforced the fuzzy semantics with mathematics ideas are implemented in advanced trading models, which assist the data analysts to make computerized automated artificial intelligence–based machine learning buy and sell signals. To sustain the artificial-intelligence applications by various categories of different types of artificial intelligence neural network like forward, convolutional, modular, and radial basis. Computational intelligence involved evolutionary intelligence techniques and algorithm enforce a collection of families of population-based experimental and error issues with solvers using a metaheuristic algorithm. Evolutionary intelligence algorithms invoke biological neural network operations such as computational reproduction, automated mutation, neural network-based natural selection, and evaluation of fitness in real entities. Computational intelligence in sustainable computing enforces artificial intelligence evolutionary computational system includes finite deterministic automata, a simplification of computerized-Turing machines, context-free-grammars enable to inspect the features of biological-based artificial intelligence neural network. Swarm intelligence applies swarm robotics, which govern and implement swarm principles and rules to automated robots through set artificial intelligence–based algorithms, which solved weather forecasting issues. Swarm robotics with genetically revised organisms applied in synthetic cooperative artificial intelligence, natural systems such as hawks hunting, bacterial growth. Artificial intelligence immune systems are one of the computational intelligence in sustainable computing, which adopts theoretically and practical based immunological and biology concepts and its functions, ideologies, and methods, which has been implemented in a fertile ground for encouragement and DNA computing. Sustainable computing makes use of well-organized physical equipment's and logical program, the dropping of electronic waste, the execution of supportable practices in management data center operations, and also reduced the negative impact on the environment caused by the fast growth of knowledge and increasing demand for computing power. Computational sustainable artificial-intelligence applied in social, environmental, and technological resources for the upcoming well-being of various civilizations through different from computer science, mathematics, and various fields. Optimization techniques are a controlling combination of methods and tools for solving complex real-world problems in different areas of optimization like linear programming optimization, intelligent-based meta-heuristics, nature-inspired optimization and applications. Optimizing the software can be achieved through virtualization, terminal servers and allocating resources strategically. Applications of computational intelligence in sustainable computing and optimization techniques are intelligent transportation systems, electrical grid, efficient power management, material recycling, cloud, edge, and parallel computing, telecommuting, real-life applications of optimization like data structure-based analysis of algorithmic optimized roaming salesman problem, financial markets, data clustering and mining, wireless sensor networks, chemical manufacturing, and so on. Finally, optimization achieved the following benefits such as improved efficiency, cost savings, improved quality, improved sustainability, and so on.}
