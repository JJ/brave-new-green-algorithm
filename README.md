Evaluating energy requirements of a Brave new Algorithm in Julia

## Brave New Algorithm Example

This repository contains a simple example demonstrating the usage of the BraveNewAlgorithm package from JuliaHub.

## Setup

1. Ensure you have Julia installed on your system
2. Navigate to this directory
3. Initialize the project:

```bash
julia --project -e 'import Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'
```

## Running the Example

To run the example:

```bash
julia --project example.jl
```

The example demonstrates a simple optimization problem using the BraveNewAlgorithm package, solving a 2-dimensional quadratic function within specified bounds.
