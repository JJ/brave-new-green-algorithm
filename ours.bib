abstract="Making evolutionary algorithms greener implies tackling implementation issues from different angles. Practitioners need to focus on those that can be more easily leveraged, such as the choice of the language that is going to be used; high-level (interpreted), mid-level (based on multi-platform virtual machines), and low-level (native) languages will need power in different ways, and choosing one or the other will have an impact on energy consumption. We will be looking at the implementation of key evolutionary algorithm functions, in three languages at three different levels: the high-level JavaScript, the mid-level Kotlin, which runs on the Java Virtual Machine, and the low-level Zig. Looking beyond the obvious, as the lower the level, the less energy consumption should be expected, we will try to have a more holistic view of the implementation of the algorithms in order to extract best practices regarding its green implementation.",

performance, and carry out experiments using EA workloads in different
platforms, eventually choosing those techniques that yield the minimum
amount of energy expenses. These techniques include a choice of differ-
ent data structures, as well as affecting compilation in such a way that
energy footprint is reduced; they have to be replicated in different com-
puting platforms because these expenditures may be affected by all the
layers of the operating system and runtime framework used. In this paper
we will experiment with different data structures and code refactoring
techniques in the low-level language zig, trying to design rules of thumb
that will help developers create green evolutionary algorithms. We will
include two different hardware platforms, looking for the one that spends
the least energy.},

abstract = {Trying to design software systems in such a way that they consume a minimal amount of energy is simply good engineering practice. Scientific software is no exception; in this case, we will put our focus on evolutionary algorithms and the energy consumption patterns in memory and CPU for two different, low-level languages: The mainstream C++ and the emerging zig. By setting up a methodology that gives us a precise measure of the energy spent by key evolutionary algorithm functions, we can give the scientific software engineer some actionable insights on how to write energy-conscious, and thus energy-thrifty, evolutionary algorithms. Our experiments show that, even with very low energy consumption in both cases, C++ can achieve a significant reduction in energy consumption for some integer-based fitness functions, as well as very good performance on classical genetic operators. Besides, the experimental results have a low variability, as compared to zig, making it in the short and medium run the best of the two languages for evolutionary algorithms.},

abstract = {Random number generation is widely used in many different algorithms, yet its inner workings and performance are poorly understood among many of its users. In this paper, we aim to explore one of its lesser-known aspects: energy consumption. Most studies on the subject tend to focus on the quality of the generators or on measuring their execution times. However, energy consumption is a critical concern today, particularly for mobile devices.In this work, we have measured the energy consumption of standard C++ random number generators. The results reveal differences in energy usage of over a thousand-fold, which could be significant for applications that require the generation of large quantities of random numbers, such as learning algorithms and metaheuristics.},

In this paper we are focusing on well-known floating-point fitness functions: some functions included in the black box optimization benchmark that cover all different types of functions under study. In general, these fitness functions will be the single operation that consumes the most energy; this is why in this paper we use them to test a methodology that is able to measure the energy consumed by their implementation in a low-level language C++. We test different single-element representations (single and double precision) as well as individual level representation (fixed size vs. variable size), drawing conclusions on the adequacy and accuracy of the methodology as well as which combination of the above elements would consume the least.",
